# ln-charts

ln-charts parses the output of bos accounting commands into various charts for your Lightning Node. It runs on Angular, JS, HTML, CSS, ngx-charts, Ionic Storage and Luxon.

You must have [bos](https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis) which runs on [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) to use this version of ln-charts.

You can run ln-charts locally or access at https://cold-sats.github.io/ln-charts/.

## Data Storage

ln-charts stores your data locally in your browser using [Ionic Storage](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/storage). Only you can see the data you upload. It will persist in your browser until you remove it using the "Clear Data" button in the UI.

## How to Build Charts

**Step 1**: Run bos commands on your Lightning node.

```
bos accounting forwards --month x --year -y --csv
bos accounting chain-fees --month x --year -y --csv
bos accounting payments --month x --year -y --csv
bos accounting invoices --month x --year -y --csv
```

You can add the `--disable-fiat` flag if you don't want bos to calculate the fiat values for your reports. ln-charts does not use this fiat value and this will speed things up.

**Step 2**: Copy and paste the output into ln-charts interface.

Highlight the beginning of the text, scroll a little so scrollbar appears, grab the scrollbar and drag to the bottom (or scroll with the mouse wheel). Then hold shift, tap the end of the text to highlight everything, and copy.

Only paste one report type at a time into ln-charts. You can include the header at the beginning or not. It can take up to a minute to paste large amounts of text. Example report:

```
"Amount","Asset","Date & Time","Fiat Amount","From ID","Network ID","Notes","To ID","Transaction ID","Type"
-378,"BTC","2022-04-04T17:38:45.000Z",-0.1755226480744611,"","","Channel close: 0:closechannel:shortchanid-794957902071791618 [Chain Fee]","","329f9f7767e4383546ef2942749554f0c1e230f8544db2992261e53d2ec8f365:fee","fee:network"
-292,"BTC","2022-04-04T19:52:57.000Z",-0.13558892390937208,"","","0:openchannel:shortchanid-803136069653233665 [Chain Fee]","","d3e69380718d54bfea8bcf25780fec7e9d2406a2617f044e6c5b51d06fa48a3c:fee","fee:network"
```

## Parsing

ln-charts automatically determines the type of report entered and parses it into multiple charts:

**Forwards** get parsed into:
- Forwards - sats earned, count, avg. earning, avg. ppm, avg. earning, sats routed

**Chain Fees** get parsed into:
- Chain Fees - sats spent, count, avg. size

**Payments** get parsed into:
- Payments - sats sent, count, avg. size
- Rebalance Fees - sats sent, count, avg. size
- Lightning Fees (doesn't include rebalance fees) - sats sent, count, avg. size

**Invoices** get parsed into:
- Keysends - sats received, count, avg. size

All charts are then summed into a profit chart:
- Profit = forward earnings + keysends - chain fees - rebalance fees - lightning fees - payments

## Exclude Lists

ln-charts has an exclude list for payments and keysends. Use it to filter out events you don't want to see in charts.

**Payments Exclude List**

Paste the text from the "Notes" column of the bos payments report. Example: ```Wallet of Satoshi```

**Keysends Exclude List**

Paste the text from the "Amount" column of the bos invoices report. Example: ```2000000```

**How to Determine What to Exclude**
1. Paste the bos accounting reports into Google Sheets
2. Select the column -> Data -> Split text to columns
3. Select all columns -> Data -> Create filter

Now you can filter the columns and browse much easier. Browse invoices report for keysends (noted as [Push Payment]). Then scan payments report for payments with unique notes.

## Running Locally

Use Angular CLI to run ln-charts locally on your computer. The data you save will persist between sessions.

Clone the repo and navigate to it:
```
git clone https://github.com/cold-sats/ln-charts
cd ln-charts
```

Install and start npm (if you don't already have npm):
```
npm install
npm start
```

Install Angular CLI globally:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Run on http://localhost:4200/#/:
```
ng serve --open
```

When running locally you have the option to save your data in the `bos-data` directory instead of inputting it into the UI and saving in cache. Only use one type of data storage at a time (either project files or inputting into UI).

When running locally you can also save keysends / payments exclude list items in the `csv-parser` provider.

ln-charts uses Google Analytics to track usage. If you prefer to not allow this, pull the `no-google-analytics` branch which does not include that.

## Backing Up Your Data

I recommend maintaining a local backup of all of your bos accounting data (if you don't run ln-charts locally and save your data in the project folders). You can export stored data as a .txt using the "Export" button shown next to each report in the UI.
